# Analyzing_CIA_Factbook_Data_Using_SQL

In this project, I worked with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like the following:

- population — the global population.
- population_growth — the annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
- area — the total land and water area.

In this project, I used SQL in Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from this database.
